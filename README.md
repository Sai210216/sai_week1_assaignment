### This the first week Assignment of Xenosis Future Internship.
### In this Assignment I have create familiarize with Java syntax, Data types, operators, control structure, and basic I/O operations.
1. Basic Arithmetic Operations using Switch Case
This program demonstrates the use of the switch-case statement to perform basic arithmetic operations. The user can choose from addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. Based on the user's choice, the program will execute the corresponding operation.
Key Concepts:
      1. Switch-case statements
      2. Basic arithmetic operations
2. Even Number Checker with Dynamic Input
This program allows users to input any number dynamically then checks whether the number is even or odd and displays the result accordingly.
Key Concepts:
      1. Dynamic user input
      2. Conditional statements (if-else)
      3. Modulo operation for checking even/odd
3. Calculator Program using Arrays and Switch Case
In this program, a simple calculator is built using arrays to Visualise Calculater and a switch-case structure to perform different operations. .
Key Concepts:
      1. Arrays in Java
      2. Switch-case for operation selection
      3. Basic calculator functionality
